          Ethical software products are good for your user and good for your business. We help you

          Discord, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. We do this through a combination of full-stack
          software development, ethical UX design, and community building.

      <p class="base-text">
        Being an asynchronous company, we have few scheduled meetings. Instead, we prioritize deep
        work and minimize distractions. Everyone codes, everyone is a decision maker, and everyone
        understands our values. We agree with our clients on our end-goals, and then we
        over-communicate as we drive towards them.
